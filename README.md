  Nice to have you here!

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **What is this shenanigan here?**

    Welcome everyone to Crazy Recipes, which I made with the help of Gatsby. I used the hello world template, so basically I started from scratch!

2.  **Are these your recipes?**

    Basically yes, I made these, they are really delicious, you should give it a go!

3.  **What did you use for this site?**

    In current form I used CSS, Formspree for storing data at the contact page, Contentful as a database, SEO for information on the browser tab, slugify, to make my links prettier, Gatsby Plugin Webfonts (so my fonts load faster), Gatsby Image plugin, source-filesystem, gatsby-node for fun. The project is shared via Netlify.

4. **Will you expand this universe?**

    Of course I will, this is only the beginning! Later on, I want to publish more recipes, add more style, everything more, just to push my limits!

5. **Oh, man, I really want to see the site working! Pretty please?**

    Here ya go: [site](')
